## Why we're building this

For the first time since Netscape in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine browsers from scratch. We saw how Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet browsers feel stuck in the past.

You probably have 70+ tabs open right now. You're constantly fighting your browser instead of it helping you. Simple tasks like "order Tide Pods from my Amazon order history" should just work with AI agents. 

We believe AI agents should automate your work locally and securely, not send your data to some search or ad company.

## How we compare

<details>
<summary><b>vs Chrome</b></summary>
<br>
While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, but Chrome hasn't evolved much in 10 years. No AI features, no automation, no MCP support.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Brave</b></summary>
<br>
We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs. We're laser-focused on AI-powered browsing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Arc/Dia</b></summary>
<br>
Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When they abandoned users, there was no recourse. We're 100% open source - fork it anytime!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Perplexity Comet</b></summary>
<br>
They're a search/ad company. Your browser history becomes their product. We keep everything local.
